# Deep learning Framework

## Description

I wrote this deep learning framework to better understand how back propagation algorithms work.



## Requirements

cmake version 3.7 or later



## Compile and build

cd into the project directory,then using these commands to compile and build

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```



## Special thanks

In this framework,I save the structure of modules as json file.Thanks to nlohmann
